# AWS

# To Deploy REST API in AWS

- it needs multiple virtual machine
- virtual machine needs to have a load balancer
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)                                   # for virtual machine
- ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)                                   # for load balancer

- ELB helps balances the EC2 instances

# To create a group of EC2 instances

- ASG (Auto Scaling Group)
- ASG help to distribute EC2 instances across multiple zones


# Regions and Zones

- deploy vm's to different parts of the world
- increase availability of the app
- It helps to avoid application downtime by deploying it in different regions

# Manage Services

- automatically setup the aws
- simple setup mentioned above  (deploy, EC2 instances, R & Z)

# Elastic BeanStalk

- automatically scale the EC2 instances based on the load
- no need to worry about the setup. It takes care of everything
