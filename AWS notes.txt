# To Deploy REST API in AWS

- it needs multiple virtual machine
- virtual machine needs to have a load balancer
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)                                   # for virtual machine
- ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)                                   # for load balancer

- ELB helps balances the EC2 instances

# To create a group of EC2 instances

- ASG (Auto Scaling Group)
- ASG help to distribute EC2 instances across multiple zones


# Regions and Zones

- deploy vm's to different parts of the world
- increase availability of the app
- It helps to avoid application downtime by deploying it in different regions

# Manage Compute Services

- automatically setup the aws
- simple setup mentioned above  (deploy, EC2 instances, R & Z)

# Elastic BeanStalk

- automatically scale the EC2 instances based on the load
- no need to worry about the setup. It takes care of everything
- useful when dealing with Single application

# Container Orchestration

- used for complex REST API / many application

    # Kubernetes
        - EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Services)
        - ECS (Elastic Container Service)

        - create a cluster with multiple nodes
        - to de-cluster, deploy the application

    # AWS Fire Gate
        - serverless version of ECS
        - serverless container option

# Serverless

- AWS Lambda
- no need to worry about servers

# ---------------------------------------------------------

# Running Database in AWS

# Manage Database Services
    - choose between sql or no-sql database
    - transactional database / application
    - used for small updates                            # e.g Inserting 5 rows, deleting 10 rows, etc

    # Types
        # SQL (Relational Databases)
            - RDS               # limited scale -- 64 TB
            - Aurora            # Global Relational Database

        # No-SQL
            - DynamoDB          # Document database


# Analytical Database
    - Used for reporting / business intelligence application
    - Hadoop

    # Load the data in bulk
        - Get all the data in the Database (RDS) and load the data in bulk in Analytical Database
        - run complex queries

    # AWS Data Pipeline
        - Use AWS Data Pipeline to get the data in the RDS / Transactional database to Analytical Database

    # Run a Analytical Database in AWS
        - Redshift

# AWS Business Intelligence Solutions

    # AWS Quick Sight
        - used to read Analytical databases to get intelligence
